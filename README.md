# Habit-Tracker
We are seeing the habit tracker application
Where we can create a user specific habits.
So if a user doesnt have a existing account they can create a new account.
We would be using the email ID and Password to sign in.
If the user has forgot the password they can able to change the password on forgot password link.
Each user can add a new habit and mark it has been done or not.
We would able to see task weekly as well as for a specific day.

Folder Structure:

assets -> This folder would be having the css file and the js file

config -> This folder would be having the configuration file
controllers -> This folder would be having function which needs to be taken place at each action
